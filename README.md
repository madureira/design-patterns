# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of some common problems of software development and how to solve them using Design Patterns.

[![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/madureira%2Fdesign-patterns.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/madureira%2Fdesign-patterns)

The examples are available in 4 different programming languages (**C++**, **Java**, **PHP** and **javascript**).

I hope that after view some of demonstrations, you be abble to identify and to apply that patterns in your projects.

Thanks for Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides, known as Gang of Four (GoF) for the classic and amazing book:

[![Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madureira/design-patterns/master/images/design_patterns_elements_of_object-oriented_software.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612).

Can not forget to mention Robert Nystrom who wrote another great book:

[![Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madureira/design-patterns/master/images/game_programming_patterns.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Programming-Patterns-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582906).

I strongly recommend you read some of this books, to get a more deep view with understandable examples and clear explanations.


# TODO
* **Implement:** ~~Creational Patterns~~
* **Implement:** Structural Patterns
* **Implement:** Behavioral Patterns

## Notes
Inside `behavioral`, `creational`, and `structural` folders, you can find a brief overview about every pattern. These explanations were taken from the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612).
