# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. A class creational pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

## Abstract Factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Factory Method
Define an interface for creating using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copyng this prototype.

## Singleton
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
